# CodeGen
This is a Unity project that has a bunch of script which generates boilerplate string definitions like tags, layers, sortings layers, and so on.

## Setup
* Open the folder as Unity project with Unity 5.6.0f3 or higher.

## How to use
Editor scripts poll modifications periodically, so you don't need to do work something for it. (auto-generated code will be stored at Assets/Scripts/AutoGenerated/* by default)

If you want auto-generations to be triggered explicitly, you can do that by deleting auto-generated .cs script.
